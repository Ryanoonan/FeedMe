# FeedMe
Feed me is a idle clicker project made over summer 2023. The game is to feed a character, who progressively getts fatter and fatter over time, with the objective to get him as fat as possible.

It is my first real introduction into game design, so it is relatively simple, but I learned a lot, and hope to continue making much more in the future.
